                <img src="assets/images/IMG_20180411_230324.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /> I am a full-stack web development engineer with over five years of experience. I possess great knowledge
                of and skills with the use of various technologies for the development of websites with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
                Currently, I am participating in a Coding Boot Camp program at Columbia University to help bring my skills
                up-to-date with latest web development technologies. I have my sights on working for a company that will
                engage my interests in web development and computer programming.
